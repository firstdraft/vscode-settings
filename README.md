# vscode-settings

Settings we recommend for student Codespaces. File contents should be placed in `.vscode/settings.json` in any given project.

- `settings.json`: For Rails projects
- `early-project-settings.json`: For first projects like "Hello World" and "Link in bio". The only difference here is that many more files are hidden from the explorer to provide a more clean and focused workspace early on.
