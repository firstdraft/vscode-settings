# vscode-settings

Settings we recommend for student workspaces.

`ruby-project-settings.json` contains additional files to exclude from view. This is meant to provide a cleaner workspace for those Ruby projects, [like this one](https://github.com/appdev-projects/ruby-project-string-1). The file needs to be renamed `settings.json` and placed in the `.vscode/` folder in those cases.
